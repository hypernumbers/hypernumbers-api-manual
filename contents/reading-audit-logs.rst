==================
Reading Audit Logs
==================

Changes to individual cells are logged. It is possible to read the audit logs of a cell. The API call is:

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|L|

=========== ============================================================
Component   Details
=========== ============================================================
Method      ``GET``

Headers     ``{"Accept", "application/json"}``

            ``{"Authorization", generated by api client library}``

Permissions ``normal`` or ``admin``

Cell        ``http://example.com/some/page/L4``
=========== ============================================================

An example of the json that returns is shown below. The logs show all the values that the cell has had, as well as the location of cell at the time it was written. A cell's address (eg ``B5``) may change in time if, for instance rows ``3:4`` are deleted. For that reason all changes that involves rows or columns are also shown. The logs are marked with the time they occurred in seconds since the Unix epoch (ie 1st January 1970).
