Numerical And Date Formats
==========================

Numerical formats are as per Excel '97. Here are some examples - those in the spreadsheet GUI.

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|L|

================================== ======================================
Format                             Output
================================== ======================================
``General``                        leaves the value unchanged

``#,0``                            100

``#,0.0``                          100.0

``#,0.00``                         100.00

``#,0.000``                        100.000

``###,0;[Red](#,##0,0)``           100

``###,0;(#,##0,0)``                (-100) if negative

``###,0.0;(#,##0,0.0)``            (-100.0) if negative

``###,0.00;(#,##0,0.00)``          (-100.00) if negative

``###,0.000;(#,##0,0.000)``        (-100.000) if negative

``"$"###,0``                       $100

``"$"###,0.00``                    $100.00

``"$"###,0;[Red]"$"#,##0,0``       $100

``0%``                             10%

``0.0%``                           10.0%

``0.00%``                          10.00%

``0.000%``                         10.000%

``d/m/yyyy``                       01/02/2013

``dd-mmm-yy``                      01-Feb-2013

``d-mmmm-yyyy``                    1-February-2013

``hh:mm:ss``                       14:29:00

``d/m/yyyy hh:mm:ss``              01/02/2013 14:49:00
================================== ======================================

The default formula is ``General``. It is not possible to remove the format from a cell, you can merely revert it to ``General``.

These formats can be set using this API call:

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|L|
