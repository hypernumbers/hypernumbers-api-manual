Overview Of Formats
===================

There are three different different types of formatting changes that you can make:

* formatting the numerical or date value in a cell
* changing the appearance of a cell
* special formats

Numerical formats change **how** a value is displayed. The raw value might be ``0.456`` but with a percentage format it will be displayed as ``45.6%``.

Cell formats might render the background of the cell as ``red`` or the text as **bold** and **italic**.

Special formats turn cells into dropdown lists, or rich text editors, merge cells or make them disappear sometimes (ghost cells).
